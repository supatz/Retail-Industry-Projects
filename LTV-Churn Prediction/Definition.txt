CLV Model Definition
For the CLV models, the following nomenclature is used:
Frequency represents the number of repeat purchases the customer has made. This means that it’s one less than the total number of purchases.
T represents the age of the customer in whatever time units chosen (daily, in our dataset). This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and the end of the period under study.
Recency represents the age of the customer when they made their most recent purchases. This is equal to the duration between a customer’s first purchase and their latest purchase. (Thus if they have made only 1 purchase, the recency is 0.)
